Arriving at the property around midnight on the 9th of August 1969, Watson climbed a telephone pole near the gate and cut the phone line. The car was then backed to the bottom of a hill that led to the house, and the murder team walked up to find the victims. 

Watson thought the gate might be electrified so he and the girls climbed a brushy embankment to get onto the grounds. 
Just then, car headlights came on from farther up the property. Ordering the women to lie down in the bushes, Watson approached the vehicle and levelled his 22-calibre rifle at the driver, 18 year old Steven Parent who begged him not to hurt him, claiming that he wouldn’t say anything. Watson first slashed him with a knife and then shot him four times in the chest. Watson then ordered Linda Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate.

Fulfillment Officer based in Germany - ecommerce store ,Business,Entry ($),Administration Assistance,GBP,10.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-02-07 07:04:15,"i run an ecommerce business in the UK, Australia and the USA called PostalPranks which sells cards and other pranks / inappropriate / funny gifts.

I wish to expand to Germany in order to expand my customer base and ship to european countries more easily. (its too hard / timely and expensive to ship from the UK).

I've found the best way to expand my business is to partner with a small operator in the country i wish to sell to (Germany in this case) to pick and pack my orders. All the items are fairly small so you typically only need a small amount of available space.

Typically the person would require
1. Some space to store my product
2. Some time each day (1 hour a day to begin with).
3. Preferably a vehicle to take the items to the local post office. (unless your local post office offer a pick up service).

Duties would essentially include waking up each morning, jumping into some software, printing off postage labels, picking and packing orders and applying the labels, taking the parcels to the post office. You would then just invoice me for the hours worked each month.

I recognise this is a bit random and has nothing to do with your original offer, but i did notice you were interested in ecommerce and thought i would chance my luck.

let me know if any of the above is of interest.

"Full Stack Developer Logic forms, Database, Rest API, app dev",Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Programming & Coding,USD,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-07 03:08:27,"Industry: Publishing/book sales and distribution.  Budget is for each element, not total.
This project consists of multiple processes to ultimately run 3 different site solutions.  However, the base of all of these processes will simply be duplicated and customized for the individual need/client site. A logic form has been created and will also need updated, so database solutions, coding, software architecture/development, app development, and experience in REST API creation will be essential skills for this job.


First: It will have to be intuitive and cross process information between two sites. The author site - uploads and creates book for publishing, creates tags and taxonomies for products on sister consumer site; Consumer site is a unique bookstore where the product data from the sister author site is automatically uploaded and becomes a part of the custom product search utilizing the tags and taxonomies assigned from site one AND auto populated by keyword from site two. 
Second: the custom search will have to be built in WP/WooCommerce
Third: once the purchases are completed on the eCommerce site a system must be created to allow metadata to be parsed and generate CSV for multiple suppliers with different CSV tag headers to process.
Finally, part three (the sales/order process) will need to be adapted to a REST API to integrate with Shopify.

There are literally thousands of metadata and tags, 50,000+ more products. Possibly designing or integrating a scraper could be an additional solution.

Speaking or understanding English fluently is a great plus!! 
Work with WooCommerce, Divi themes, WP
REST API creation experience
Logic forms, Database organization
NOT a cookie cutter bookstore or eCommerce site.  Multiple sites must integrate.  We also have several other small projects that need help so there is plenty of work ongoing.  Budget is flexible if my WISH LIST can be done.  Our previous developer was awesome but got recalled back to his inhouse job.

Imagine Barnes and Noble store integrated with KDP book creation, and a full functioning automated distribution process combined.

Assist with sourcing manufacturing partners in Rio De Janeiro.,Business,Entry ($),Consulting,GBP,10.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-06 19:06:39,"Hello PPH,

We are a small engineering design company based in the United Kingdom. One of our directors will be in Rio De Janeiro on other business in mid-February (10th to 18th Feb). 

We are interested in finding potential suppliers in the Rio area that he could visit while in the city. We design and outsource manufacture of various components for a range of industries, but in the main they are relatively small turned and milled components - all achievable on standard machining centres. Think automotive parts and components (which in the main they are). They are all in aluminium, steel, stainless steel, or other commonly available materials. 

We would like to find a Portuguese speaker, ideally in Rio, with an engineering supply / purchasing background who can provide local knowledge on small scale or prototype machining / manufacturing companies. Our director will have one or two days to look at potential manufacturing partners. 

The batch sizes we usually order from other overseas suppliers are usually between 50 and 500 pieces at a time.

We don't need to meet you in person or have you come along to see these companies. We are simply looking for someone who can give us a steer on who (in Rio) might suit our needs and have a good reputation. They will also have to be willing to ship the components to the UK. 

We would also welcome approaches from people with this sort of knowledge concerning other offshore manufacturing opportunities. ",,2020-05-14,Northampton,United Kingdom,GBP,

"Full Stack Developer Logic forms, Database, Rest API, app dev",Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Programming & Coding,USD,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-06 22:25:26,"Industry: Publishing/book sales and distribution.  Budget is for each element, not total.
This project consists of multiple processes to ultimately run 3 different site solutions.  However, the base of all of these processes will simply be duplicated and customized for the individual need/client site. A logic form has been created and will also need updated, so database solutions, coding, software architecture/development, app development, and experience in REST API creation will be essential skills for this job.


First: It will have to be intuitive and cross process information between two sites. The author site - uploads and creates book for publishing, creates tags and taxonomies for products on sister consumer site; Consumer site is a unique bookstore where the product data from the sister author site is automatically uploaded and becomes a part of the custom product search utilizing the tags and taxonomies assigned from site one AND auto populated by keyword from site two. 
Second: the custom search will have to be built in WP/WooCommerce
Third: once the purchases are completed on the eCommerce site a system must be created to allow metadata to be parsed and generate CSV for multiple suppliers with different CSV tag headers to process.
Finally, part three (the sales/order process) will need to be adapted to a REST API to integrate with Shopify.

There are literally thousands of metadata and tags, 50,000+ more products. Possibly designing or integrating a scraper could be an additional solution.

Speaking or understanding English fluently is a great plus!! 
Work with WooCommerce, Divi themes, WP
REST API creation experience
Logic forms, Database organization
NOT a cookie cutter bookstore or eCommerce site.  Multiple sites must integrate.  We also have several other small projects that need help so there is plenty of work ongoing.  Budget is flexible if my WISH LIST can be done.  Our previous developer was awesome but got recalled back to his inhouse job.

Imagine Barnes and Noble store integrated with KDP book creation, and a full functioning automated distribution process combined.

Magnetic Signage for Van,Design,Entry ($),Logo Design,GBP,60.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-03 12:39:38,"We are a successful screen and digital print company, based in the southeast UK. We advertise on a variety of social media sites attracting a reasonable quantity of enquiries on a daily basis. A fair percentage of these enquiries fail at the first hurdle as generally, the prospective client has no artwork for the requirements. Whilst we have studio facilities, we don't seem to be able to tap into our guys' creativity when it comes to logo design etc.

More often than not there's very little to work with by way of creative assets being supplied, and the enquiry then doesn't gather any momentum due to there being little or no creative input coming from our side. What I am looking for is someone capable of using minimal assets (normally just web url pointers to show what they may already have in place for example, or scrappy jpegs/Word documents which aren't a lot of use to us) to be able to come up with a workable artwork scamp for use in bringing the client's requirement to life.

Typically the cost of the completed magnetic signage to suit a standard Transit-style van is sub £500, so the client's perception of any artwork cost within that figure is generally sparse!  What I would propose is being able to offer an artwork design scamp for a fixed fee of say £30.00, with another similar amount to then cover finalising the design for production once the client has approved the design offering. We would provide vector based templates to suit the vehicle(s) in question.

This will be done in Photoshop, carefully using the full process shown here in this tutorial.

Care must be taken to ensure the highest quality of final illustration to ensure that the person in the image is still highly recognizable.

We're helping a pharmaceutical products wholesaler based in England. They are going to be moving from a temporary site based on Opencart 2 to a new site likely based on Opencart 4.

We have already designed and built the front-end HTML. We’re looking for someone to take this HTML and integrate it as a fully functional Opencart 4 site.

Additional Requirements
In addition to fully integrating the HTML into Opencart 4, the client also has the following additional requirements (please see the sections below for more details):
Integrate into Microsoft Dynamics Nav - to bring in customer pricing, export orders from the website into Nav, flag up customer accounts so certain products cannot be purchased (this will happen if an account is not verified).
General public can see all products, however some products cannot be ordered without a verified trade account. The existing Opencart 2 site and database already has this data and logic integrated.
3 product templates - depending on the amount/type of information
Product Options - colour & size etc
Product Accessories - batteries, fittings etc
Brand category
Minimum Order Quantity
Saved baskets
Re-order from previous orders
Add Purchase Order Number
Main User plus sub accounts (main user can see all orders and which sub account purchased which items)
Sector category - GP, Podiatrist/Chiropodist, Physio, Nursing etc
Category filters - brand, price, colour etc
Consideration into exporting products from the current website into the new website.
Supplier integration/product feeds/import

Re-ordering from previous orders
There should be an add-to-favourites system so customers can build up a “shopping list” and use it to re-order products – we have this on our existing website. If products are discontinued, then they mustn’t be able to add it to the basket and checkout. They should be able to remove it from their favourites and any other products they want to remove from their shopping list.

Payment Methods
Need different payment methods for different account types – an invoice on delivery 30 days credit account, and a pay by card option.

SEO
Some form of SEO to be built into the site eg. keywords for products, categories and home page etc.

The full wireframe, specification and designs for the project are available to those interested in this opportunity, which lists the additional features and how they should work in more depth.

Make my Website Fully Responsive,Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Website Development,GBP,300.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-02 17:51:26,"Hello all,

I would like to hire someone with the right set of skills to work on my website and make it ***fully responsive*** once and for all. This means that upon work being completed, the website will look good on all mobiles, all tablets and all laptops.  

This is my website: https://krakencountercouture.co.uk  

Over the years plenty of people have brought up complains about the site not being responsive, but sadly I wasn't able to afford to do much about it.   
The arrangement of images and text seems to come out messy/overlapping/at times even missing from a device to another.  Overall, the site not pleasing to the eye, cohesive and it's hard to navigate it, especially on mobile phone of all manufactures... Which are what most people use to browse the internet these days anyway. 

 If you're confident you can do it please:  

- Could you show me examples of previous responsive websites you worked on.  

- Let me know how'd go about it. I need to make sure you can work ""remotely"" while it's a work-in-progress, so not to affect the experience of potential customers on the site.

  - How much it could cost. I want a fixed price.  

- How long would it take? Ideally I'd like to get this out of the way ASAP and no later than Feb 19th 2023.

  To help you with the task, I can prepare a screenshot by screenshot guide to the changes I'd like by viewing the website from my MacBook Pro 13-inch Laptop and my iPhone 8 mobile phone.  

  I do not own a tablet or any other device to help with those, so I will need you to suggest a ""Responsive Screen Simulator"" I could access time to time to double-check changes as they will appear everywhere else. Can you help with that? 

Thank you all, I'm looking forward to reading your proposals.

There is more work that will follow after this task as we are looking maximise the use of Twilio in our organisation. So after successfully implementing the above code the freelancer should also make an implementation plan for Twilio usage. Then we can discuss the next task.

See Sample Code below:
import requests

# Replace the placeholders with your actual Twilio account SID and Auth Token
account_sid = '{AccountSID}'
auth_token = '{AuthToken}'

# Define the friendly name, sender type, and sender ID
friendly_name = 'Learn English Maths Messaging Service'
sender_type = 'AlphaSender'
sender_id = 'learnenglishmaths'

# Set up the request headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
}

# Set up the request data
data = {
    'FriendlyName': friendly_name,
    f'{sender_type}': sender_id
}

# Make the POST request to create the Messaging Service
response = requests.post(
    f'https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/{account_sid}/Messaging/Services.json',
    headers=headers,
    auth=(account_sid, auth_token),

Court Action Against Morrisons Legal Action Lawyer Barrister,Business,Entry ($),Legal Services,GBP,45.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-02-02 09:35:45,"Hello i do hope you day is going well today and thank you for your interest in my project.

I was harassed back in September 2022 by a security guard and senior management on leaving the Morrisons grocery store. The alarm sounded and i was chased outside the store. Despite showing my receipt, my bags were searched twice, the senior management was aggressive and so was the security. I was intimidated, harassed, despite no evidence of shoplifting. I was off work and so was my mother with health issues and this situation has caused worsening health problems. No apology was provided and there was no evidence of shoplifting to begin with. 

I have heard many other customers state the alarms sound incorrectly and Morrisons even admitted that the alarms can sound for lots of reasons such as metal on your bank card. They still carried on with aggressive searches and intimidation, which i have the CCTV footage of despite showing my receipt and having no evidence of shoplifting. 

Morrisons have responded to a letter of claim denying liability, as you might expect, all companies try to avoid any liability or being fair. I wanted some advice on the costs to take this to court and any help with getting representation if this goes to trial in the County Court. 

Thank you so much for your time and i do very much look forward to working with someone shortly. Take care.    ",,2023-02-02,Huddersfield,United Kingdom,GBP,

Some guidance as to analytics would also be great.

In play there will be 9 areas that moles can appear on the screen. When a mole appears and the tap area or keyboard/joystick button is pressed the user scores a point.

The moles will appear on the 9 different areas randomly.

Pressing the wrong area joystick/keyboard press will do nothing.

If the user takes longer than 1.5 seconds to whack the mole in time they loose and the game displays high score with 15s countdown timer asking user to continue.

As the score increases the moles appear faster and faster intervals like 50, 100, 150

Moles can appear in multiple areas at the same time aswell, as the score increases.

If continue not pressed/clicked in 15s game resets back to start insert credit screen.

Would like the start screen to keep the high score displayed at all times.

I can provide artwork and background/gameplay music.

This game can either be built as a windows .exe with the 9 areas and start/continue responding to keyboard/joystick inputs or as an Android game and I can program touch areas to the 9 mole areas and start/continue.

Each ""Hints and Tips"" section will contain advice to support an individual’s development for the specific Competency and associated behaviours.

Example of one Competency:
""Enagagement and Commitment""
- Embraces and supports and promotes change within the team by leading by example
- Goes the extra mile and acknowledges others going the extra mile by providing appropriate feedback

I am founder and CEO of a company that makes high quality websites and web applications. We have been in business for 22 years and still going strong. Our clientele are luxury businesses and individuals.  

We are in the finishing stage of restructuring our business. Our new website will be done every day now. We need new leads! Let me be more detailed.

We need someone, or an agency, that will go through our website and make the texts and everything else better. When I say better, I mean for the texts to resonate with our targeted audience, and increase SEO ranking. We have no idea what to do with About page and how to improve there, hence we will need your suggestions here as well.

Furthermore, if you think something should be added/removed from the site, we will listen to your recommendations.

Most importantly, we need that our new site GENERATES leads! This is critical! We are open for newsletter campaign, cold emailing and SEO (making our website rank high in Google search). We DON’T want any kind of social media marketing. 

I am waiting for your offers and strategies you think are best to generate leads. Also tell me approximately how long and how much until first leads start contacting us? Budget is negotiable.

Create a white labelled version of an existing website,Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Website Development,GBP,60.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-02-01 12:23:04,"Project Background

My name is Oliver Gledhill, I am an entrepreneur based in Malton, North Yorkshire focused on the digital space.

Over the last few weeks, like others, I have been monitoring the explosion in growth of Chat-GPT3 and therefore been considering use-cases of this technology.  One obvious use-case is the integration of Chat-GPT3 with existing Live Chat solutions such as Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp to help business users manage conversations more efficiently.

As part of my research, I have found multichannel marketing platforms such as Sendpulse offering chatbot solutions that integrate with Chat-GPT3.

I would like to offer Sendpulse to my clients as both a SaaS platform and a potentially managed service.

Challenge

Sendpulse provides customers (including agencies) access to a Sendpulse branded dashboard where they can log in and manage multiple chatbots across platforms such as Messenger, Instagram, and even WhatsApp - as an agency I want to avoid my clients seeing the Sendpulse branding on the dashboard. 

Solution

I would like to understand how you might be able to help me solve this challenge and the associated costs and development time frame.

Ideas

Idea 1 - I had considered creating a new sub-domain for a dashboard of my own and then using the forward with masking functionality to mask the send pulse login link to my own, for example - login.businessbot.tech however the Sendpulse logo and other links would still be visible.

Idea 2 - As above, I had considered creating a new sub-domain for a dashboard of my own then serving the Sendpulse dashboard to users through an iFrame and using Javascript to replace the Sendpulse logo/links with my own.

Idea 3 - Sendpulse does have an API with a number of different endpoints, I have therefore considered creating a new sub-domain to host a basic dashboard allowing users to view statistics, send messages, mark messages as read, etc…  links to API documentation are listed below:

Messenger - https://sendpulse.com/integrations/api/chatbot/facebook
WhatsApp - https://sendpulse.com/integrations/api/chatbot/whatsapp
Instagram - https://sendpulse.com/integrations/api/chatbot/instagram
Telegram - https://sendpulse.com/integrations/api/chatbot/telegram

Whilst idea 3 could be very basic initially, I have provided below a link to the Sendpulse platform and some mock-ups of how ideally I would like my customer journey to look including the following three pages

Page 1 - Login
Page 2 - Main Dashboard 
Page 3 - Chat Page

We have several products - digital and physical - that need to be launched in-market simultaneously. As a PM, you will be responsible for driving the product strategy, end-to-end management of projects, and ensuring the team is aligned and working efficiently to deliver high-quality results.

Having strong knowledge of marketing tasks and working with the digital marketer to ensure marketing efforts are delivering results
Analyzing analytics reports and communicating with the team to ensure everyone is aligned and working efficiently
Providing bi-weekly progress reports to the co-founders

To be successful in this role, you must have experience in delivering SaaS projects and/or launching successful eCommerce products. Additionally, you must be able to talk to marketing and product metrics and have excellent communication skills to lead and motivate a remote team.
Initially, this will be a part-time position, but once the team is onboarded, you will transition from working part-time to full-time. You will be compensated with an hourly rate and a percentage of every unit sold through our sites.

After the launch, there is potential for growth and advancement within the company, whether it be moving onto a new project, working with our agency, or scaling the current project.

The team will be responsible for developing software, websites, designs and other digital products that can be used in UK and Taiwan government and private sector projects. The target audience for these programs is working professionals/graduates who are looking for remote work opportunities.

All members must be available to work (Monday-Friday) and cooperate with project deadlines and other team members. Since this is a remote project, team members must also be familiar with video conferencing (via Zoom, Skype, etc.).

All team members must log in to the company's team system and actively participate in team discussions. Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of any rewards. Since it is a remote project, all developed software, websites and designs must be independent products, and no additional salary requirements are accepted during the contract period. The main sources of income are project bonuses and client tasks. In addition, all team members must cooperate with the company's external services. Finally, we will not tolerate continued violations of company policy or delays in the work of our teams, and may result in termination of employment.

We do work for a few clients, we go out & carry out the survey, capture the information and write up the survey and submit it. Our internal quality control are very strict on what’s acceptable and what they submit to the client who requests the surveys (our customers).

I can send you samples of existing surveys. I have two surveys to write up at the moment from the information I captured on the site visit this week and other supporting information like insurance schedule, template for survey, etc.

The questionaire we use to capture information on the survey visit has always been written up but I’ve typed it to improve speed. The document also needs sorted as it does not lend itself well and not straight forward but that’s another story….it’s what’s in situ.

Are you interested? I have given you the background information to help you out. It will take 2-3 hrs to write them up.
Key elements of the survey is the executive summary at the start which is split into a few parts, the requirements at the end, recommendations, turnover, no of employees, attach a few key photos,etc.

This is a requirement for a person or persons who has excellent report writing skills. I need a person or persons who can take our notes, images /pictures captured, refer to company documentation, use our templates and compile a professional risk survey report. The right person will be excellent at English grammar and spelling, have a high attention to detail and enjoy writing reports.

The turnaround needs to be 1-2 days.

Two interactive websites needed,Technology & Programming,Expert ($$$),Website Development,GBP,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-30 15:03:22,"Hello all:-

We are looking to create two websites that are similar and different at the same time. 

The first site is designed for drivers who wish to join our taxi company to put their details and upload their credentials, insurances, licenses etc. What am looking for in the design of this website is an element of interactivity. For example the landing page would welcome the driver, and ask him for his first name, then when the driver inputs the name they press next, and it asks them for their last name, and so on. Every page that comes after that will ask for a required information for registration. For example it will ask for their vehicle make and model, it will ask to upload their picture, and so on. I hope I explained myself very well. We do have an active domain we would like to use, also this website must work in the same way on mobile as well as desktop. 
All the uploaded information should come to our email for us to process. 

The second website is different, as it is for a sister company that deals in crypto. We want the same style of page design where the customer is asked questions and according to their answers are led on to the next appropriate page. 

The premise for the second website is to trade crypto for cash. There will be an element of API to the crypto exchange to get accurate and updated prices. Also, as with the website above, the answers should be complied and send to our email to process.

Video Production Company Proposal,Design,Expert ($$$),Graphic Design,GBP,19.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-30 11:22:27,"We are a Video Production company who are looking to update their proposal document. 
Our current proposal was made in photoshop which although gets the job done, is time-consuming when needing to update the document to accommodate the next project/client. 
We are looking for someone to produce a new design within Adobe Indesign which is eye-catching, yet simple and clear. The template needs to be easy to update, saving us a fair amount of time in the pre-production process. 

Every page will stay the same, apart from the (How much will it cost?) page. This will be updated to suit each project. We need to be able to change the project brief and the Cost table. Not all roles will be needed, however, there will always be three columns: ROLE, QUANTITY & RATE. 
We need the cost page to be as simple and as easy to fill out as possible. 
It would be great if a new row in the cost table could be made effortlessly.
It would also be great if somehow the 'Quantity' and 'Rate' columns synced up. So that when the quantity (days) changed, the 'Rate' would update alongside it. 
This would also be great in connection to the final costs section. (All of the 'Rates' automatically add up to produce a total figure). These are all in replacement of having to change things manually. 

We aren't familiar with InDesign and simply want the quickest and easiest process to be able to change the 'How much will it cost?' page, so we have no idea if any of this is possible. 

We are open to any ideas which could help us with what we are after.

for example: We created a log file in root - and print the occurrence of duplicate which returning like below, you can see that, row_order is null even if query correctly have the values:

1) PID: 24700 buyer_id: 53 current_time:1674657417 row_order: Order Id: 65 SELECT id FROM wp_job_orders WHERE pid = 24700 AND uid = 53 AND date_made = 1674657417

The voice artist would have to save each dialogue in one wav-file, so he/she would be sending 100 files to us  (you don't have to save every single sentence in a separate file, we'll do the splitting ourselves later on). 

Between the various ""speaking parts"" (one speaking part sometimes comprises more than one sentence) the voice artist needs to make a pause of about 2 seconds, so our technician can then split the various sentences more easily. 

Since we offer this content in many different languages and we need to be able to align each single sentence with its counterpart in another language, it's important that the above-referenced pause is kept during the recordings in order to facilitate our file splitting. 

The complete length of the recordings will be around 1.5 hours.

This is a fixed price offer. Please only bid if you agree to this price. We do not accept any request for a change of price once the order has been placed.

The word count is roughly 15,000 words, although we'd like to reiterate that we go by the time of the recording (see above).

The sentences should be read with a natural diction, but not too fast (please listen to the enclosed samples of the male voice artist).

I am looking for someone who can design an original collage of pictures that would be inspired by the pictures that I have attached. Importantly, the photo collage will be ONE piece of artwork, not multiple. The pictures that I have attached are from album covers of artists who create ""LoFi"" music (LoFi is a genre of music). If you do not know what that is, you can listen to that type of music here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfKfPfyJRdk (it may even be helpful for inspiration). The entire picture collage will need to be approximately 19x15 (19 inches length, 15 inches width) and I plan on framing it. I do not need each individual picture to be the exact same length and width as the others, but I do need the final product to be rectangular (once again, 19x15).  The main color theme needs to be blue and white (similar to the color of my wallpaper in the picture attached, but it does not need to be the exact same). Other colors are more than welcome to be used if your creative instincts say to do so. To clarify: the picture of my wallpaper is inspiration for the color theme, the picture of the collage is inspiration for the design/shape I want, and the picture of the river in the forest is for creative inspiration.

I need your assistance with an online sales web-based site for people to enter a dancing (Acrobatics) competition.

The hope is to have a complete set-up website (can be Shopify) from around 1 February to 1 April.
People must be able to enter the competition from the site and give all the details, such as:
1. Name of Participant
2. Surname of Participant
3. Club Name
4. Date of birth
5. Contact email
6. Then they must be able to choose from the example of the different sections under six years – Novice Duet.
7. Each participant must pay the once-off registration fee and can then enter as many events as possible
8. There are also duets and larger groups. 
9. Each item has a title and must have the name of the participant or a duet or group space for the terms of the people in a group (max 10)
10. Each type of entry has a different price
11. All participants pay a once-off registration fee.
12. Pupils must be able to upload their music. In other words: When they enter the item, they must upload the music they will use. When they upload more than one item, they must also be able to upload the music for each item. We must then be able to ""download"" all the music they will use. We will need your input on how to link the music to the item they entered. 
13. The people must fill a cart with their registration fee and the items they want to enter and then pay, linked to one of the payment providers. 
14. They must see their ""entry"" receipt with an entry number.
15. From the back end, we must see all the person's entry details and have a link with their uploaded music. There must also be a link/place where they can upload their music if they don't have it ready when they enter. 
16. Entry can only be 'valid' after payment.
17. The site's overall feel must be ""happy"", professional and organised – we have a logo etc. A professional look is important
18. I will need to know that the person helping has done this type of work before and would need examples of their work.
19. The work offered must be better than what I can do for myself on Shopify.

I am looking for a friendly php tutor/teacher who can help me build a dropdown search bar for some CPT UI posts in WordPress. I need someone to help me with php over the next few months as I want to learn more. Soemone based in Scotland would be ideal.

I can send the example to the right candidate.

The dropdown filters are relatively simple apart from one which needs to take in 2 ACF date fields and compare them against a set range of dates in a dropdown (This Month, Easter, Christmas). Please include 'phpacf' at the beginning of your reply.

I have tried using FacetWP and would like to extend this plug in if possible. However, I would be willing to code the whole filter bar from scratch with tutoring/explanation of the code.

Look forward to connecting.

Long-term video editor for Youtube channel (1-2x per week),"Video, Photo & Image",Entry ($),Filmmaking,USD,50.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-28 04:32:27,"Background
Hi! My name is Peter and I have Youtube channel with 1.3K subscribers where I post videos (1 to 2x a week) around the creator economy, self-improvement, and lifestyle topics (https://youtube.com/petersu). I'm looking to hire a long-term video editor for my Youtube channel - someone who's excited to tell fun visual stories, help people improve their lives, and who takes pride in their work. 

Ideally you’ve edited a lot of Youtube videos (talking head + vlogs), follow instructions cleanly, respond to feedback/revisions well, and use Final Cut Pro X so I can make any final changes before exporting if necessary. 

Responsibilities
My videos have ranged from 3 to 20 minutes but are usually around 8 to 10 min and your editing would include: 
–Picking good takes
-Keeping smooth pacing
-Adding tasteful text and simple motion graphics
-Picking relevant b-roll that enhances what I'm saying
-Adding music and SFX that heightens the emotion (big plus if it’s tastefully cut to the beat)
-Doing basic sound mixing like compression and EQ
-Doing light color correction and color grading
-Adding pictures/funny memes/transitions/effects occasionally
-Ideally injecting your own creative secret sauce in the mix too
Extra bonus if you can research Youtube tags/titles, and eventually upload to Youtube. 

Workflow
I'll supply you with:
-Raw footage (4K via Google Drive)
-Assets (fonts, text, graphics, access to royalty-free music libraries and stock footage)
-Comments via Frame.io

Sample links for my general style and tone:
https://youtu.be/O_PJmCrzack
https://youtu.be/MQxFtYk_VA4
https://youtu.be/oNC0g3jO7ks

Next Steps
If you're interested, please review my sample videos and reply with:
1) Why you're interested
2) Editing software you use
3) Links to your portfolio
4) Turnaround time
5) Number of revisions you can do (we’ll aim to lower this over time)
6) Estimated cost to make a video like my samples
7) Please include the word ""Purple Yoda"" in your first sentence. 
  
If there's a good fit this could be a high volume of videos for you for a long time and could potentially expand into editing podcasts and shorts as well. Thanks and I'm looking forward to chatting.

1. Create two new product attributes called x-axis and y-axis.
2. On the product page check to see if the product has values for both of these attributes.
3.If so display the multiplication table in a tab using the values
If not, do not display the tab or grid
4.When the product is bought, a comment should be added to the order stating the values of the x and y axis, if they exist

The following points apply and should always be followed.

Magento provide their own Programming Best Practices that should be followed at all times.

The code should be valid according to the coding standards Coding Standards

Code should be written in a testable manner

The code should adhere to the technical guidelines as much as possible

In addition, all PHP code should be strictly typed, strict comparisons should always be used, and unless prohibited by class contracts strict parameter and return types must be used.

Fully qualified class names should always be imported and short class names used

The completed code should run without error in all cases.

Deprecated or legacy functions denoted by Magento should not be used

Where necessary, code comments should be used

Method and class annotations should be used where necessary to describe parameters and return types

Main Requirements:

Your task is to do the following

Create two new product attributes called x-axis and y-axis
On the product page check to see if the product has values for both of these attributes
If so display the multiplication table in a tab using the values
If not, do not display the tab or grid
When the product is bought, a comment should be added to the order stating the values of the x and y axis, if they exist

To help complete the task there is a template repository that you can use. 
This will automatically run the tests that you create and preform static analysis on the code each time you push a commit. You should use this to create a private repository in github and then share that with us when complete.

Module Setup:

The module should run successfully on the latest version of Magento 2

Coding standards and guidelines should be aligned with the latest available Magento version.

All code should be placed in a module called 
NathanCommerce/MultiplicationTables

Attribute Management:

The attributes should be created using a data patch

The values should be validated to ensure that they are either
Both set as positive integers
Neither are set
If neither of these conditions are met then an error message should be displayed, and the product is not saved

Product Page:

If both attributes are present a tab will be displayed

This tab will be called Multiplication Table by default

When clicked, a multiplication table will be displayed using the values from the product

If the values are not present, or the values are invalid, then no tab will be displayed and no error will be displayed

Order Comment:

This should be handled using an event listener

The comment should only be added once

It should say $productName was ordered with these dimensions $xAxis by $yAxis

If there are multiple products in the order with the attributes, then each product should appear on a new line within a single comment

Module Configuration:

Within the Configuration menu in the admin, there will be a tab called Nathan Commerce

Within this there will be a section called Multiplication Tables

This section will contain these options
The ability to enable and disable the module. When disabled no multiplication tables should be displayed on the front end and orders should not be affected by the multiplication code when placed.

The ability to change the title of the tab on the product page

Documentation

You should create, in Markdown format as a README.md file in the root of your module, a set of instructions that cover both developer and user level documentation. * How to install it * How to configure it * How to run the tests

Basic Testing:

Unit tests should be created for parts of the code that are free of dependencies. These should cover all paths through the code under test and ensure that it gracefully handles success and failure conditions.

Integration Testing:

The module should be mainly covered with Integration Tests
Other test types can be created if useful

Fixtures should be used where appropriate.

Feel free to make use of our testing module to help with this

Hi! My name is Peter and I have Youtube channel with 1.3K subscribers where I post videos (1 to 2x a week) around the creator economy, self-improvement, and lifestyle topics (https://youtube.com/petersu). I'm looking to hire a long-term video editor for my Youtube channel - someone who's excited to tell fun visual stories, help people improve their lives, and who takes pride in their work. 

Ideally you’ve edited a lot of Youtube videos (talking head + vlogs), follow instructions cleanly, respond to feedback/revisions well, and use Final Cut Pro X so I can make any final changes before exporting if necessary. 

Responsibilities
My videos have ranged from 3 to 20 minutes but are usually around 8 to 10 min and your editing would include: 
–Picking good takes
-Keeping smooth pacing
-Adding tasteful text and simple motion graphics
-Adding music and SFX that heightens the emotion (big plus if it’s tastefully cut to the beat)
-Doing basic sound mixing like compression and EQ
-Doing light color correction and color grading
-Adding pictures/funny memes/transitions/effects occasionally
-Ideally injecting your own creative secret sauce in the mix too
Extra bonus if you can research Youtube tags/titles, and eventually upload to Youtube. 

Workflow
I'll supply you with:
-Raw footage (4K via Google Drive)
-Assets (fonts, text, graphics, access to royalty-free music libraries and stock footage)
-Comments via Frame.io

Sample links for my general style and tone:
https://youtu.be/O_PJmCrzack
https://youtu.be/MQxFtYk_VA4
https://youtu.be/oNC0g3jO7ks

Next Steps
If you're interested, please review my sample videos and reply with:
1) Why you're interested
2) Editing software you use
3) Links to your portfolio
4) Turnaround time
5) Number of revisions you can do (we’ll aim to lower this over time)
6) Estimated cost to make a video like my samples
7) Please include the word ""Purple Yoda"" in your first sentence. 
  
If there's a good fit this could be a high volume of videos for you for a long time and could potentially expand into editing podcasts and shorts as well. Thanks and I'm looking forward to chatting.

Learning Outcome: describe the role of CAD/CAM in automated manufacturing

A.
1. Determine the benefits and limitations of components manufactured by forging versus machined from plate metal 
2. For a range of given components, investigate the most appropriate manufacturing methods

B.
1. Describe the selection of machining processes depending on part geometry: i.e. flat and
cylindrical geometry (e.g. the learner will understand appropriate machining processes depending on the geometrical form of the part required)
2.  Understand the impact of material removal rate on surface finish and texture as well as speed of
production (e.g. how material removal rate during conventional machining should be considered and its impact on the properties of the base material)
3. Understand  the effect of production volume (prototypes, batch, and high volume) on the selection of the appropriate process and tooling (e.g. appropriate manufacturing processes and tooling depending on the required batch size.)

C.
1 Describe the application of bonding technologies (e.g. material selection, appropriate application of bonding, e.g. welding, adhesives)
2 Describes the types and use of mechanical fastening (screwed fastenings, e.g. metric bolts, studs and set screws, self-tapping screws, locking devices; rivets, e.g. snap head, pan head and countersunk heads, bifurcated and pop rivets)
3. Understand the use of limits and fits during part to part assembly (e.g. use of limits and fits tables for typical engineering applications such as holes and shafts)
4. Evaluate how limits and fits influence fastener application (e.g. application of clearance fit fasteners vs  interference fit)
5 Evaluate how the choice of bonding process can influence the product design (the learner should investigate an application where the types of bonding has influenced the component design)


I need the following for the above learning outcomes:
- written content to cover the points above with links to external resources such as videos and reading resources where relevant.
- assignment questions to test learner knowledge of above together with model answers

Secondly, I had rented out a bag to a client last year, she didn't return it and had damaged the earrings. We reached out to her as she would have to replace/repair the goods in line with our terms and conditions, however she claimed that the bag was sent back. We then decided to file a dispute through the small claims court, she then asked us for a mediation call through the courts which we then agreed to. She didn't bother turning up to this, so we proceeded to submit our witness statement and bundle. We then had to pay over £350 for the hearing fee. The court hearing took place last week, I had written to the court to inform them that I wouldn't be in attendance, however it seems that they receive that and my absence was taken negatively and the claim was struck out. FYI she didn't attend either, I would like to revisit this as she is sitting on an expensive bag and I think we were treated incredibly unfairly by the court.

YOUTUBE CHANNEL ,Social Media,Intermediate ($$),YouTube Marketing,USD,100.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-26 19:34:45,"Hi James based on your message following is the proposal which I am happy to proceed with. The all inclusive budget is $100

My proposal of $40 contains:
- Editing the About for the channel
- Creating and Editing a description template pre-made for all the videos.
- Editing the titles on ALL the videos (I usually charge for 10 titles, but for this project, I'll do them all since you don't have extremely many videos)
- Editing tags across all the videos that you have
- Generating tags that you can use in your future videos
- Editing playlists with description and tags.
- Fully optimizing your channel with SEO
- Give you tips on the new videos (on your niche category)
- Give you COMPLETELY FREE TOOL to generate tags and see which videos are searched in the niche of ""Pakistan"" and ""Travel"". It is widely used by lots of YouTubers that know it, so this one will definitely help you now and also in the future to generate real and organic traffic by your niche.

For additional rebrending such as Design and Video, I can offer to make you:
- A really nice YouTube channel banner
- Logo for your YouTube channel
- Create a template pre-made lower-third popups that you can use in your videos to promote your YouTube/Facebook and Instagram (if you have one, which is pretty important, if not no problem)
- Video Intro for your videos OR Video Intro for your reels (intros are different, either for a normal video or reel)
- Video Outro for your videos OR Video Outro for your reels (outros are different, either for a normal video or reel)
- Watermark for your videos, in case when your videos go trending people can not STEAL your idea. It will stop that.

The visual branding opportunity has not been included in the proposal since your original job requires only SEO and optimizing and managing your YouTube channel once. Although, if you would like, I would really be happy to make all these graphic changes because they can really SKYROCKET your YouTube channel, and I usually charge 100$, which in total would be $140, but in case you are interested and I want to start the new year by doing really nice work for only certain amount of the price, I will do everything for only",,2010-09-19,Purfleet,United Kingdom,USD,Diector

Specialism: our client is a global bank, however the meetings you’ll have to attend are going to be interviews and case calls for their Employee Relations teams. 
Turnaround time: you will have 24-48 hours to complete the summary of each attended meeting
To assess your suitability for the role, could you please confirm:
1.	If you have experience with professional writing into the requested target language?
2.	If you are able to cover these meetings remotely considering the location requirement? You must be based in China\Singapore.. Does that work for you given your current location? 
Please note that Global Lingo pays minute-takers per minute of meeting and this rate comprises the effort of both attending the call + taking notes and then completing the final summary.  
Finally, please note that you will have to attend our live induction/training sessions (one for each language combo) ahead of the project start. During that session, you will also be required to take a live minute-taking test which will simulate a real-life scenario.

"""Unlock Your Imagination"" Looking for a children's illustrator",Design,Expert ($$$),Illustration & Drawing,GBP,24.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-26 08:44:53,"OBJECTIVE:
To create a set of playful and engaging illustrations for a new toddler and baby brand that will appeal to both children and parents.

Target Audience: Parents and caregivers of babies and toddlers (ages 0-3)

Key Message: Our brand is all about fostering creativity, imagination, and learning in young children through fun and interactive products.

There will be 2 visual styles and we can share a figma board that we started to provide some initial guidance.

**1st Visual Style**
Bright, colorful, and playful with a focus on children's themes like:

1. Pirates
2. Dinosaurs
3. Space / Planets
4. Unicorns
5. Stars
6. Zoo Animals
*not limited too

These should be easily recognizable to young children. The illustrations should be inspired by the natural world and should be engaging and interactive for children.

We are looking for a cross between:

Realistic: This style aims to depict people, animals, and objects as they appear in real life. It often uses detailed drawings and accurate colors. This style can be used for educational books for children.

Fantasy: This style is characterized by imaginative and fantastical elements such as magical creatures, enchanted landscapes, and otherworldly settings. It is often used in fairy tales, myths, and other stories that appeal to a child's sense of wonder and imagination.

**2nd Visual Style: 'Scandi Mum'**

Scandinavian mum style, often referred to as ""Scandi mum"" style, is a minimalistic and functional approach to parenting and motherhood. This style is characterized by a focus on simplicity, practicality, and comfort. It is often associated with the Nordic countries of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and is known for its clean lines, neutral colors, and natural materials.

Scandi mum style is often reflected in the way that mothers dress, with a focus on comfortable and functional clothing that is easy to move in. This can include items such as oversized sweaters, leggings, and practical shoes. The color palette is typically neutral, with a mix of gray, black, white, and beige tones.

The aesthetic is also reflected in the way that mothers decorate their homes, with a focus on minimalism and functionality. This often includes natural wood elements, light-colored walls, and simple, uncluttered spaces.

Scandinavian mum style is also associated with an emphasis on outdoor living and an active lifestyle. This is often reflected in the way that mothers dress their children, with a focus on practical, functional clothing that can easily be worn while playing outside.

In summary, Scandinavian mum style is a minimalist, practical and comfortable approach to parenting and motherhood, characterized by simple, natural materials, neutral colors and an active lifestyle

Tone: The illustrations should be upbeat and positive, with a focus on fun and learning. They should inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity in young children, and should encourage them to explore and discover the world around them.

Deliverables: A set of illustrations suitable for use across our range of products packaging, advertising materials, and in-store displays.

This can include illustrations of individual products, scenes featuring the products in use, and standalone illustrations that convey the brand's message and values.

Timeline: The illustrations should be completed within 4 weeks.",,2023-01-26,Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,USD,

See attached JPG for work in progress. We would like to print 3D versions for use in their retail space. I am guessing that the first stage in delivering that process is to create 3D designs. Please tell me if I am wrong. There are 30 icons in total. They will all be about 50cm x 50cm x 50cm in size (very rough dimensions for now) which I am telling you in case it is relevant. They could be bigger (1m cubed) or smaller (25cm cubed) but that is the best I can say for now. We may not do them all, we might do some of the easier ones, we might even redesign them if they don't work that well for 3D printing purposes. In fact, we might even use 3D versions on the website - in time, we might even animate them. We have already animated the 2D versions. So, the first stage in the process is to find the person we want to work with on this project from a 3D design perspective.

There will most likely be a series of illustrations & animations needed. Although I am also working on getting up to speed with Blender, I may not always have time to do some of these projects myself so I am looking for someone that will be available for ongoing work.

Please send only a few specific examples of your work or a few specific links to view - I do not want to be overwhelmed with tons of content to wade through - a few good examples is all I need to get an idea of your suitability for this work (technical, simple machine rendering & animation - high quality, photo-realistic). As to level of complexity - think of a garage door that can be rendered from different angles and can be animated showing it going up and down; or, a locker opening and closing.

Pricing for this will have to wait until you have all details (sets of 2D drawings  showing front, side, top views will be supplied to give a full understanding for what is needed). Prior to project commencement, a NDA will be sent and details will follow after NDA is signed and returned to me. Additional clarification can also be via email communications, phone discussion and zoom sessions - there are also some photographic references and other visualization resources.

The price plugged in below is not relevant since PPH requires an amount to post the job, price will be determined after you have all the details and the NDA is signed.",,2014-01-15,San Antonio,United States,USD,

Data Research - Find UK Cyber Security Recruiters + Headhunters,"Marketing, Branding & Sales",Entry ($),Strategy & Research,GBP,80.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-25 13:00:39,"See template output deliverable attached (especially row 4 that provides ""Guidance Information""). In short, I am seeking to get the contact details of UK based Cyber Security Recruiters who focus on placing contractors (not permanent full time positions, contracts should be the focus). The details required are set out in the template attached.

Recruiters want to get contacted so finding the required information should be easy (unlike finding sales leads for industry clients who don't want to get contacted). I accept sometimes the odd data point (i.e. landline phone number isn't available for the odd person). Important notes;

- Cyber security recruiters are those who specialise in the following terms; information security, cyber security, CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) and Head of Information Security or Head of Cyber Security.
- Please also look for ""headhunters"" > these specialise particularly in finding senior contractor positions and candidates.
- Please try to find two different people per company. Ideally I want a head of team, i.e. ""Desk Lead"", or ""Head of Cyber Security Recruitment"" and then a much more junior role, i.e. ""Researcher"" or ""Cyber Recruitment Consultant"".
- Looking for HIGH QUALITY DATA > please test emails for validity using an online tool. A sample of the output will be audited and any poor or inaccurate data will be identified and not paid for.
- I have no real number of names required, however many there are that are high quality. I expect around 100-200 perhaps.
- You'll likely find it easiest/fastest to start the research by researching the companies who specialise in cyber security / information security / IT security recruitment in the UK  and then find the right people (not the other way round).
- Price: please be competitive with your quotes. The £80 price is just a placeholder and expect the winner will be able to do it for less.

If this is a successful project I will need a similar project to find EU recruiters and recruiters placing into the UAE/Middle East too. Any questions just ask!",less than 1 week,2018-12-13,London,United Kingdom,GBP,

the pixel implementation affecting performance,Technology & Programming,Entry ($),Website Development,USD,180.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-25 05:59:36,"My Face book sales have dropped and the agency have asked to fix the following below. Does anyone understand and able to fix this isuue please?


There's an issue on the Purchase event, I've forwarded the info to you on another email. Please can you ask a web developer to check the pixel implementation, something is affecting the account's performance. here is the pixel implementation, something is affecting the account's performance. 

They were unable to fix the issue and have sent me this

Edward's had a look but can't see an error on the pixel! After more research, I've found a few users talking about this error. 
 
Who do you use for making changes to the website? They could be best suited for resolving the issue. 
 
To resolve this issue, you'll need to identify and fix the cause of the redundant Purchase events. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Review your website's purchase flow: Make sure that the Purchase event is only firing on the final confirmation page of the checkout process and not on any other pages, such as the cart or product pages.
2. Check your Shopify settings: Go to your Shopify admin and make sure that the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting is not enabled. This can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Check your pixel implementation: Make sure that the pixel is properly installed on your website and that it's only firing the Purchase event once per transaction. Use the Facebook Pixel Helper chrome extension to check for any errors.
4. Check for duplicate pixels: Make sure that you only have one pixel installed on your website. If you have multiple pixels, this can cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
5. Check for third-party apps: If you're using any third-party apps that add tracking pixels to your site, make sure that they are not firing the Purchase event multiple times.
6. Check for any scripts or codes that may fire the purchase event multiple times
 
There can be several reasons why your pixel is now firing redundant Purchase events, even though it was working correctly last month. Some possible causes include:
1. Changes to your website's purchase flow: If you've made changes to the pages or flow of your checkout process, it's possible that the Purchase event is now firing on multiple pages instead of just the final confirmation page.
2. Changes to your Shopify settings: If someone enabled the ""Enhanced Ecommerce"" setting in your Shopify admin, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
3. Issues with your pixel implementation: If there are any errors in the way the pixel is installed on your website, it could cause the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
4. Changes to your website's code: If you've made changes to your website's code, it's possible that you've introduced new scripts or codes that are firing the Purchase event multiple times.
5. Third-party apps: If you've recently added or removed any third-party apps that track pixels on your site, it could have caused the Purchase event to fire multiple times.
6. Caching Issues: Sometimes, if the cache of the website or browser is not cleared, the previous events might be still present and firing, even though they should have expired.

I am looking for someone to create 30 short social media posts for my company. I would like 30 posts to start and would potentially need this as an ongoing service. 
I run a recruitment company and would like to have more presence on LinkedIn. I don't post a lot on our company page so I am looking for some short written posts to boost increase our content. 
Each post should vary in length between 40-100 words.
I am open to suggestions regarding the content of the posts. We offer both a corporate recruitment service (i.e.. recruiting candidates on behalf of companies) as well as jobseeker services such as CV writing etc. I envisage most content being focused on providing tips to jobseekers or comments on the recruitment industry. 

Content must be original and not copied!
 
Example 1: 
The average time employers spend looking at your CV is just 6-7 seconds. Your CV is your first impression…make sure it counts! If you are struggling or would like some advice with your CV, please get in touch today! 

Example 2: 
Searching for a new job can be quite daunting. Your mind will start to go fuzzy looking at all the different job boards out there. Sometimes, one of the best ways to find a job, is to avoid job boards! Making a short-list of companies you would like to work for and regularly checking their career pages for new opportunities is an easy way to narrow down your search.

Human Helix,Design,Expert ($$$),3D Design,GBP,500.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-24 12:50:57,"HI

I need a high quality finished result so please apply if you feel you have a strong understanding of figurative 3D skills and the ability to work well to this brief.

What we need:
A 3D sculpture, In the shape of double helix made out of people. They should be a mix of genders and ages. Almost like a a baroque painting, cherubs and nudes. 

An important factor is that the figures need to represent African descendants. So, some with dreadlocks etc

We do not need the faces too detailed so I would love it if you can make the general form quite angular and flat so we haven't got the issue of detail making the file too large - so, a flatter, chiseled finish please.

Please make the file available for blender and 3D printable too. The maquette/model will be about 40cm tall but we may need to enlarge it in the future so please give me access to different sized files too. 

We have 3 weeks before I need this job done and i will need updates as we go.

I will attach different images to show you the type of shape of a DNA Helix - please note, the groove element that will be explained in the file - this is how the curves go in an A, B, A pattern of one large one small - look it up if u need, there are many videos on youtube. Or ask and ill send you some.

I will also attach ideas of how the figures will hold each other too.

One image is AI generated and of the figures holding hands - I like everything about this apart from how they are holding each other- I need them to be hand to foot or hand to hand, maybe to convey the bit in the middle of the DNA strand you can have a person go across it too.
Also i do not want to see a seperate helix - just the one made from the people.

I have a more simple example of how this project was done at earlier stage with just hands that i will send to you after as its a large file.

This will be an ongoing project so plenty of scope to work together more if you can smash this one for me.

Your job will be to write the CSS selectors to program a web scraper to gather data from online retailers. You can verify the selector works by running document.querySelector(SELECTOR) or document.querySelectorAll(SELECTOR) in the dev tools console. 

1. pageNumberParameter - Paste the URL parameter that determines which page of results to show, e.g. from this link ""https://www.very.co.uk/sports-leisure/mens-sports-clothing/outdoor/e/b/119443,2781.end?pageNumber=2"" you would find ?pageNumber=2 and replace the page number with $i so it becomes ?pageNumber=$i
2. acceptCookiesSelector - This one is only required if the site has a cookies popup that blocks the page. Paste the CSS selector for a button that accepts the cookies.
3. pageCountSelector - CSS selector for the button or other HTML element where the innerText is ONLY the last page number. E.g. if there are 30 pages of jeans, find an element whose only text is ""30"" - this is typically located with several page buttons that might look like 1 2 3 4 5 ... 30
4. searchPageGrid - CSS selector on the search page for the container that holds all the links to product pages.
5. searchPageOrigin - CSS selector for the a tags with hrefs linking to product pages, duplicate hrefs don't matter but try to skip any ads. Instead of running document.querySelectorAll, this will be run like searchPageGrid.querySelectorAll so sometimes this can be simple as ""a""
6. searchPageTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the search page
7. searchPagePrice - CSS selector for the CURRENT product price on the search page
8. searchPageThumbnail - CSS selector for the product thumbnail on the search page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image. Make sure it works on all the products on the page because sometimes they're lazy-loaded.
9. productTitle - CSS selector for the product title on the product page
10. price - CSS selector for the product price on the product page
11. oldPrice - CSS selector for the original product price on the product page (if it doesn't exist, leave blank, but make sure to check at least one discounted product)
12. image - CSS selector for the first product image on the product page, must have a src or a data-src or a data-srcset attribute with a link to the image
We will be running the scraper and checking that each site is scraped correctly. You will be paid for each retailer you complete so make sure there are no errors. It should take about 10 minutes per retailer. If you're unsure how to write the selectors on a site/field, move onto the next one and fill in the text box(es) with the word TODO and we'll complete those ones. Start your proposal with ""CSS Selector"" so we know you've read it all. 

We're looking for someone who can scrape 75 of these sites this week. If you do a good job on this, there may be ongoing work for you as we add more retailers.

To source,… 
T-bars 2. Chain (with unique design) and 3. Jump rings that have all already been designed and are available to buy to create a series of 16cm long pieces of chain that will have a T-bar at one end and a jump ring at the other end.

Just Like this Skull Bracelet But with Openable-Closable Jump Ring
One of the attachments shown below shows a skull bracelet that looks very much like the kind of 16cm long piece I would to have created - please note the T-bar at one end and jump ring at the other. The 16cm chain lengths will be employ to create chain-leather-chain handbag straps like the one shown in one of the attachments below. Without the need for cutting/welding, a handbag factory will attach the chains to leather straps by prying the jump rings open, threading the jump rings through eyelets on the leather straps and then closing the jump rings closed - that why the jump rings at the end of each 16cm long chain length has to be openable-closable. 

Material
Ideally, I would like these creation to look like shiny silver but be created from the kind of material usually employ to create handbag ‘hardware’. Oftentimes this is zinc alloy or brass, I think.


A Set of 4 Identical 16cm Long Unique Chain Pieces  (Times At Least 4)
For the first such unique chain that is sourced I would like four identical of such 16cm long pieces created. Then I would like to repeat that at least three more times - with three different unique chain designs. (So in total, I will end up with at least 16 pieces of the 16cm long creations.

FUTURE BRIEF…If the Business Does Well..Fully Bespoke 16cm Chains
If the business does well in the medium to long term future, I most definitely will be having 10s, maybe over 100, of such chains that are fully bespoke created. If you service this brief, it is most likely that you will be the first person I will come to when  fully bespoke chains are to be created.  

I am based in the U.K. Wherever you may be in the world, I hope we can work out a way to work together at minimum risk to both you and myself. 

I have quoted a rough guide fee of £250 fee that is negotiable.

I need a programmer who is experienced in the development of video chatting app that will connect people randomly and/or based on interests. Both text chat and video chat.

I am an IT engineer so I know some stuff about app development, but I am not a developer and am not an expert. 

Initial version will be a proof of concept that will only randomly connect people with an option for registration. During this phase graphics, branding, colouring will be nailed down along with minimum functionality. Consider this phase a trial that, if the result is good enough, will result in a permanent arrangement.

Later the app will feature paid subscription functions, and should be able to securely hold client details. It should also allow automated card payments via Stripe or similar. It will also feature SMS activation for new user accounts and CAPTCHA to weed out bots.

Later revisions will begin to include social elements such as friending/messaging/following. Videos will also later be scanned for inappropriate/illegal content with users facing a resulting ban.

The UI should be vibrant, simple and streamlined to QUICKLY collect required details from the user, and then get them into the video chat as quickly as possible. It should be enjoyable to use, with effects such as moving graphical backgrounds, fades, and such.

The 'fun' element of the graphical user experience is of high importance. See: Every other social/chat/dating app ever made for examples. It should be slick, professional and not look or feel cheap/glitchy. 

I would like to see the following from interested parties:
- Examples of your past GUI/UX work, vibrantly branded and enjoyable/exciting to use. Examples of the animations and smooth transition between screens would also be desirable.
- What you would recommend to hold client details. Integrate with an existing CRM, or build something custom? Indicate why. Security is of paramount of importance.
- To work on Android/Apple/Web, whether you would use multiple native apps, or a hybrid app. The user experience must not simply be a responsive webpage cheaply wrapped in an app. It should feel native with little/no latency and smooth animations between screens. How would you achieve this? I have heard of Flutter as a potential modern solution to the native vs. hybrid problem. Would you use this, or a different method? Explain why.
- Examples of animated transitions between screens, seamless integration with branding and colouring across all screens.
- App logos. I want you to design the branding as well as develop the app. Show me your past work.

I have put £30 per hour as the rate, however the budget and spend will ultimately depend on the quality of the developer's past work.

I would like to NOT see the following from interested parties:
- A list of URLS to the Play Store or Apple store showing your work. Use attachments.
- Irrelevant examples. Book keeping apps, maps, project management... these are entirely irrelevant.
- 1000 words about you/your company. I do not care. Show me your work.
- Assuring me you are the best person. Everyone says this.

Please see the chart for an illustration of columns B, C, and D versus the events in column A.

1. I need a VBA or formula solution estimate best fit, while also accounting for the following:
2. The solution needs to take into consideration the following constraints:
a. Events can only happen within the given earliest and latest estimated dates and times seen in columns B and C.
b. Events can only happen between a minimum time and a maximum time defined for each day, see table Calendar in the sheet Time_constraints. (If a day isn't captured in this table, the minimum time should be 11 AM and the maximum time should be 22 PM).

I have 4 joomla sites which need to be housed on my godaddy package.  The previous host has sent me links with the files zipped together.

They've said it's a five minute job to replace each on GoDaddy and I could probably do it myself, but I'd rather trust a pro!

In addition to moving them I need to make a few minor tweaks - just removing the odd picture, hiding one page.

But I also wanted to check sign up boxes (to MailChimp) and the boxes for finance payments/and form applications to make sure they're working properly.

could you kindly quote me?

here are the sites:

www.wildfrontierproductions.com - straight move no changes
www.britishfilmmakersalliance.com - move, remove a couple of things and check sign up boxes are working
www.worldfilmshowcase.com - move and make sure the forms and payment pages are working

Just a brief outline of the situation: 

1. I had an existing Adsense account.

2. I opened a youtube channel for a friend and it automatically connected to that Adsense account (as I am new to 
youtube and Adsense I did not know how it worked properly).

3. I went through all of the steps and got the account verified. 

4. As the Adsense account was in my name so I had to put my own personal Tax information to the Adsense account. 

5. All was going well and we were views and getting paid, but the owner of the channel wanted to put the Adsense account in their name. 

6. Not knowing the consequences, I created an Adsense account under their name and tried to connect it to the 
Youtube Monetisation part. 

7. Youtube rejected the application stating: ""Thank you for your interest in AdSense. After reviewing your application, our specialists have found that it does not meet our programme criteria. Therefore, we are unable to accept you into our programme. Our AdSense programme policies are designed to ensure the effectiveness of Google ads for our publishers as well as for our advertisers. We review all publishers and we reserve the right to decline any application. If you are able to make changes to meet our programme criteria, you may reapply for AdSense in the future. Please note that we may not be able to respond to enquiries regarding the specific reasons for our decision. Thank you for your understanding. Thanks, The Google AdSense Team""

It's not really an explanation of why it was rejected. 

8. The option to update, or fix anything on the channel has been restricted it is making us wait 32 days. (see attached image)

French speaker to contact with FR Uni radio stations Mon morn,"Marketing, Branding & Sales",Expert ($$$),Sales & Calls,GBP,150.0,remote,ALL,fixed_price,2023-01-21 17:27:24,"Through our French Partner Campus Radio we have been developing a radio drama project with 6 university radio stations accross Frane. The project is concluding next week and our link person the facilitator from Campus Radio has gone awol.

We urgently need someone first thing Monday morning to get on the telephone to the six radio stations and discover:

a) who the students / volunteers for each project with each radio station are / were.
b) contact details for any of these - especially phone numbers
c) where they have got to with their project in each case (to make 7 minute radio dramas from a choice of scripts)?

The important things are a and b) . If we can make contact with the student / volunteer groups themselves on Monday we can probably take things forward from there. (Our mission is to get the plays finished by the end of the week and see if a representative from any of the groups would like to come to the whole project convention in Albanian next weekend!

Skills

a) Comfortable with French (University +/ native speaker) as persuading University societies to give up information is going to be needed.
  
b) Real persistence and doggedness as important as anything - this is NOT a situation for someone to say ""well its just a voice mail so I sent them an email"" - its going to be about finding clever ways to contact hte university, its student radio organisation and the collection of students involved.

A sheet is attached of the 6 relevant stations and the contact details we have. All of them were working with Elodie Hervier - the facilitator who has gone completely awol. Also we have the contact details for the central organisation Campus Radio as well.

We are proposing to pay £25 per successful contact with an actual student / volunteer from each group - so that is up to £150 which might take a morning or two mornings.

That is Monday morning 23rd January

Business Plan to establish a Finance  Company in Nigeria  ,Business,Expert ($$$),Consulting,GBP,75.0,remote,ALL,hourly,2023-01-20 13:31:00,"Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a significant role in the development of the economy of many countries. According to the World Bank1, MSMEs represent about 90% of businesses worldwide. The growth of MSMEs in many countries, however, is often stifled by limited access to finance, as financial institutions are less likely to provide funding to MSMEs due to the high-risk nature of their businesses.

In Nigeria, the finance company licence was established by the Central Bank of Nigeria (""CBN"") to focus on meeting the financial needs of MSMEs. The CBN regulates finance companies through its Revised Guidelines for Finance Companies in Nigeria (the ""Guidelines"") issued in 2014.

A finance company is a company licensed by the CBN to provide financial services to individual consumers, and industrial, commercial or agricultural enterprises. These services include providing consumer loans, funds management, asset finance, project finance, local and international trade finance, debt factoring, debt securitization, debt administration, financial consultancy, loan syndication, warehouse receipt finance, covered bonds and issuing vouchers, coupons, cards and token stamps.

Hi,

Please refer this project--
 Grammarly API at https://developer.grammarly.com/

You have to use this API to feed in a folder containing PDF Files as input, and the Grammarly API will paraphrase the text and return a number of equivalent PDF files which will be saved to disk.

ALso refer this URL--> https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/use-yolov7/
YOu have to modify it so that it accepts a list of images in a folder and saves the output as an XML file. It gives list of objects in an image (OBject recognition).

Finally 3rd task is new-- go to an API, take output XML of previous step as input, and get as output (a) Images only (b) Illustrations only.

ANd 4th task-> PDF of step 1 has tags like img1.png and so on, simply insert output of 3rd step, which is img1.png of pdf(all images in a PDF one by one)-> 2nd step gives text based on the image--> 3rd step gives new images based on text ie objects in original image--> now insert all new images at placeholders for various images in PDF file.

THe main tasks are already coded as explained above. You have to combine these into a single Python project.


Do let me know if you can do this work.

1. First one: short (20-30s) motivational video with a bunch of concepts of how “Together We Create” (our theme for 2023) is the first three words of many different statements.  Here are some of thoughts:  
 
Our Vision Statement is “Creating a world where mental health is in reach for all.”  
 
“Together We Create”  
 
Together – keeps the element of teamwork and alignment.

We – non-descript as to who this is which is intentional.  Is it the US and Israel? Sales and Marketing? BrainsWay and our customer partners (doctors) ? Individuals aligned on a share mission and vision? Yes.  All of the above. (And there is a capital “W”…)

Create – this is the first word of our vision.  It is a powerful word.  It means to make something that was not there before.  New opportunity? Aligned teams? Successful Customers? Efficiency? Momentum? Progress? Hope?  Once again, all of the above.  
 
I could see this as a short video of these words at the end of “Together We Create” to make complete sentences…something showing a cycle of these phrases to show the versatility.  Maybe using the photos of the teams all gathered or opening new clinics.  End with adding the “Together We” to the front of the vision statement.  
 
Our values of Teamwork, Optimism, Creativity all play into this. 
 
Photos and logos will be provided. (can use them with combination of stock images if needed)Please, send your quotes and timelines. Again, it should be a short but sweet 20-30s video. Thank you!

2. 10-15sec video/animated photos of all employees together showcased in a creative ways. Submit your ideas!

• DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAIN
The Drakensberg Mountain is the largest mountain on the Get a Bear Island. It is located on the Dragon Isles at the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The mountain is inhabited by lots of mountain goats, who are the fastest animals on the Island; snakes can also be found on the mountain. The dragons sometimes eat the goats when they are unsuspecting but if there not fast the goats immediately run far away. A mysterious thing about the Drakensberg Mountain is that; the right side of the mountain is always dark. The sun never seems to be able to penetrate into that side, no matter how brightly it shines. The light always stops short of the farther right side of the mountain. Many have been too frightened to explore it and it has been told that those who did never returned.

• THE GULF OF DRAGONS ISLES
The Gulf of the Dragon Isles is located at the top right corner of the Get a Bear Island Map; beneath the Dragon Isles. The gulf is home to hundreds of fish. Sometimes, you can see a dragon diving in to the water to swoop up a fish or two that comes close to the surface. So, if you ever wish to sail through the gulf, make sure that you cover your raft with branches and move slowly so that they think that it is only a piece of wood floating by to avoid drawing the dragons’ attention. You also have to hang on tight to the boat because of the rough waters that can occur and rocks that could break the boat in a second. The water temperature is usually very low so it is mostly freezing cold; this is because of the current pulling water in from the Blizzard Plains.

• DRAGON ISLES
The Dragon Isles is located towards the upper right side of the Get a Bear Island; by the right ear of the Bear. The island is the origin of one of the creatures; whose statue is in the Land Of Honour. He is the Dragon Chief who rules the Draconic Clan. The weather in the Dragon Isles is mostly windy, whether it is night or day. The Dragon Isles has a very large mountain on it. The mountain is the largest structure on the Get a Bear Island. The mountain is called Drakensberg and it is the pride of the Dragon Isles. When men used to hunt dragons, it caused all the dragons to flee to the Drakensberg Mountain to hide; so, whenever rain falls, it rarely reaches the ground because of all the giant dragons there.",,2017-11-27,Glasgow,United Kingdom,GBP,

At the moment, if the user selects ""For Apple"", like this: https://www.juicebitz.co.uk/collections/usb-2-0?filter.p.m.custom.compatible_brand=For+Apple

We have that many models for all mobile phone manufacturers, that we don't want to be shown like the example above, but only the matching products under that Brand should be shown.

For instance - if For Apple is selected, only iPhone & iPad models should show, no Samsung, no Huawei etc etc.

We do have the Metafields in place for the filters as you can see in the images attached.
We also have Product Tags which could help assist with the implementation.

Thanks for looking.

Company registers (Register of Directors, Register of Members and Register of PSC, i.e. total 3 registers per Company) to be generated based on records kept on public register at the UK registry. Experience and familiarity at dealing with records/filings at UK registry is essential to be able to extract the necessary details to generate/update the correct registers. Sample format will be provided.
Initially, the registers for 10 Companies are required. Some companies/registers will be very quick and straight forward with sole director/shareholder; some may be a bit more complex and take longer/require deeper review of the past filings carried out at the registry to ensure correct register/s is/are generated to reflect any changes in directors and members etc. Looking forward to your offers and please confirm the relevant experience.
